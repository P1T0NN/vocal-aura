        bio: [
            "Originally from Venezuela, Jose [JO$S] relocated to Spain five years ago, drawn by its rich electronic music culture. His journey began with an insatiable drive for track mixing, but upon settling in Valencia, he delved deeper—studying the city’s nightlife and shaping his own artistic identity within its evolving underground scene.",
            "Jose’s sound is a dynamic fusion of tech house and hardgroove, blending the groove-heavy rhythms of house with the fast-paced energy of techno. Initially inspired by hard techno, his style evolved as he discovered hardgroove’s seamless balance between intensity and dancefloor fluidity. His sets reflect this progression, offering a carefully curated, high-energy experience that showcases both precision and passion.",
            "Influenced by industry giants like Marco Carola, The Martinez Brothers, Michael Bibi, and Latin tech house pioneers Harvy Valencia and Moreno & Prieto, Jose also draws from hardgroove icons such as AAA+, Jon10, Alarico, Jeff Mills, DAVE The Drummer, and Guy McAffer. His performances are a testament to his evolution—not just as a DJ, but as a tastemaker shaping Valencia’s electronic landscape."
